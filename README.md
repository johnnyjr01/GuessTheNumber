Number Guessing Game
Description

This is a simple Java game where the user has to guess a random number between 1 and 100.
The player can choose between three difficulty levels, which determine the maximum number of attempts allowed:

    Easy: 10 attempts

    Medium: 5 attempts

    Hard: 3 attempts

During the game, the program provides hints to help the user by indicating whether the target number is higher or lower than the guess.
How It Works

    When the program starts, the user is asked to select a difficulty level by entering 1, 2, or 3.

    A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.

    The user inputs a number as a guess.

    The program responds with:

        "The number is lower" if the guess is too high.

        "The number is higher" if the guess is too low.

        "Congratulations!" if the guess is correct.

    The game ends when the user guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

    If attempts run out without success, the correct number is revealed.

How to Run

    Make sure you have Java (JDK) installed on your computer.

    Compile the Main.java file:

    javac Main.java
